# ID1019 - Programming II
This is a **course in functional and concurrent programming** given at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

The programming language used was originally Erlang but we're now moving to Elixir.



### Lectures

There will be 14 lectures that will go through the concepts of
functional and concurrent programming. We will use Elixir as an
example language but the lectures are more focusing on the bigger
picture. Learning Elixir is something you best learn when programming.

### Exercises

It is highly encuraged to do several of the exercies. Once you get the
knack of it they are quite easy and vill hopefully give you some
deeper knowledge about functionbal and concuurent programing besides
learning Elixir.

exercises. During the seminars we will dicuss how to best solve
problems and pros and cons of alternative solutions
