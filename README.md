# ID1019 - Programming II
This is a **course in functional and concurrent programming** given at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

The programming language used was originally Erlang but we're now moving to Elixir.

### Seminars

The seminars that we will use each year will be a subset of the
exercises. During the seminars we will dicuss how to best solve
problems and pros and cons of alternative solutions

### Exercises

It is highly encuraged to do several of the exercies. Once you get the
knack of it they are quite easy and vill hopefully give you some
deeper knowledge about functionbal and concuurent programing besides
learning Elixir.
