## General guidelines
This repository contains the code for a course in *functional and concurrent programming* at KTH, Royal Institute of Technology. The course originally used Erlang as programming languge but it has switched to [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.github.io/) since spring term 2018. The assignments files and the lecture slides are written in [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/). Git-flavoured Markdown and Makefile are also used.

If you are knowedgable about Elixir or about the topic in general or you feel you can contribute to the improvement of the course you are very welcome to help. Below are more informations about [how to contribute to the codebase](#how-to-contribute-to-the-codebase).

If you find any mistake, bug or error and you do not know how to fix it, you can file an issue. We will try to solve the problem as quickly as possible. More about how to *properly* file an issue in the section [how to create an issue](#how-to-create-an-issue) below. 

**IMPORTANT: issues are for problems in the code or in the structure of the repository. DO NOT file an issue to ask for an explanation of a part of the topic you do not understand!**

Two general rules for any contribution:
1) Communication is fundamental: get in contact with the main mantainers of this repository and explain the intention and reasons of your work. Get feedback on how the others see your work. **If you do not know, simply ask!**.
2) Keep the code clean, modular and observer general rules of writing good code. More information about coding style in the [specific section](#coding-style-and-conventions) below.
